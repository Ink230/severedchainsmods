# Legend of Dragoon Java - SCDK

A project to reverse engineer Legend of Dragoon into a high-level language with a modding API. This is not an emulator, but assembly code disassembled and rewritten in Java.

This repo is focused on testing mod support for the SCDK version of the main decompilation project.
